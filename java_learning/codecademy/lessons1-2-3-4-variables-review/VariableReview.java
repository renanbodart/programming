     * 1 - int: The first type of data we will store is the whole number Ex: number 22 (The int data type allows values between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647, inclusive)
     * 2 - double: can hold decimals as well as very large and very small numbers. The maximum value is 1.797,693,134,862,315,7 E+308, which is approximately 17 followed by 307 zeros. The minimum value is 4.9 E-324, which is 324 decimal places!
     * 3 - boolean: These questions are answered with a boolean, a type that references one of two values: true or false.
